QuickcyCss
==========
(STILL IN DEVELOPMENT)
QuickcyCss makes drafting websites quick and easy! 

Some time like today at work i get asked to knock up some websites with just unrealistic times. I get told "The code does not matter, We dont care if the code does not mean standard X, Y and Z"

That why i created quickcyCss!

Baiscally when rushing and taking time in making websites you often throw in paddings, margins, font-sizes that are individual to that specific div or span etc

When rushing a website why do this 
<code><div id="text">some text</div></code>
Then to do this in the style sheet
<code>#text{
	padding-top:10px;
	padding-bottom:20px;
	width:100%
}</code>

When you should do
<code><div class="padding-bottom-20 padding-top-10 width-per-100">some text</div></code>
DONE! It saves me time and its easier to play around with paddings etc as i can just quick alter the class
<code><div class="padding-bottom-24 padding-top-12 width-per-50">some text</div></code>


This was not make for proffesion web design but for them occasions where you have no time!
