QuickcyCss
==========
(STILL IN DEVELOPMENT)

##QuickcyCss makes drafting websites quick and easy! 

Some times like today at work, I get asked to knock up websites with just unrealistic time scales. I tell them its impossable to make something proffession in that time scale but I get told "Make it look good! The code does not matter, We dont care if the code does not mean standard X, Y and Z"

##That why i created QuickcyCss!

Baiscally when rushing and taking time in making websites, you often throw in paddings, margins, font-sizes that are individual to that specific div or span etc

So why do this 

	```
	<div id="text">some text</div>
	```

AND Then to do this in the style sheet

	```
	#text{

		padding-top:10px;

		padding-bottom:20px;

		width:100%

	}
	```

When you could do this

	```
	<div class="padding-bottom-20 padding-top-10 width-per-100">some text</div>
	```

It saves me time and its easier to play around with as i can just quickly alter the class
	
	```
	<div class="padding-bottom-24 padding-top-12 width-per-50">some text</div>
	```

##Proffessional Disclaimer
This was not make for proffesion web design and development but for them occasions where you have no time and the quality of code does not matter!
